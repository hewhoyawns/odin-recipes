    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite parts of hibachi is the fried rice and I was determined to make it at home. This recipe is quick and easy and is sure to be a big hit. I enjoy using left-over teriyaki chicken in my fried rice, but you can use any meat you want or no meat at all! With or without chicken it is equally as delicious and a great side dish! You can use more or less garlic, depending on your personal preference.  Yields 6 servings. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
